## About Me
Hi! I'm Laurie, a software engineer with a collaborative spirit and a designer's eye.    
With extensive eCommerce experience, I excel at communicating with users, empathizing with their needs, and solving their problems.    
As a versatile dev I communicate with clarity and compassion. Curiosity and creativity drive me; I look for innovative solutions and am always on the hunt for increased efficiency.

Let's work together!
